### Hi!

I'm Hashm, a student in Toronto, Canada.

I am fluent in python3 and I'm trying to pick up other languges.

My programs aren't anything crazy but I have a couple cooler ones like <p href="https://github.com/MD5-Hashm/always-fill-reqs-python3">Always-Fill-reqs-python3</p> and <p href="https://github.com/MD5-Hashm/Tic-Tac-Toe">Tic-Tac-Toe</p>

I hope you find somthing cool in my repos :)
