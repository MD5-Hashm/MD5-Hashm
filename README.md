### Hi!

I'm Hashm, a student in Toronto, Canada.

I am fluent in python3 and I'm learning [golang](https://github.com/golang/go).

My programs aren't anything crazy but I have a couple cooler ones like [Always-Fill-reqs-python3](https://github.com/MD5-Hashm/always-fill-reqs-python3) and [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/MD5-Hashm/Tic-Tac-Toe)

I hope you find something cool in my repos :)
